CHATBOT also known as conversational agents are designed with the help of software. 
They simulate a conversation with users in a natural language via messaging applications, websites, mobile apps, or phone.
So in this Chatbot project, we are going to make an AI-based contextual chatbot that will maintain the context or in which sense or proportion the user is asking a query. 
Further using deep learning techniques in Python, we will construct a Sequential model for our training sets of data. The intents, patterns, and responses will all be used to train the chatbot. 
The userâ€™s query will be mapped to the intents class using neural networks, which will maintain context and then return a random response
